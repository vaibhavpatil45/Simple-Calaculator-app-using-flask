## Description
This project is a simple calculator web application built using Flask, HTML, and CSS. Users can input two numbers and select an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division) from a dropdown menu. Upon submitting the form, the application calculates the result based on the selected operation and displays it below the form. The entered numbers persist in the input fields after calculation, allowing for seamless multiple calculations without re-entering values. The design is clean and intuitive, providing a user-friendly interface for basic arithmetic operations.
